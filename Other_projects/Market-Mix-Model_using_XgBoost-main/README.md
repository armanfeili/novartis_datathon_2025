# Market-Mix-Model_using_XgBoost

This project demonstrates how to use XgBoost, a popular machine learning algorithm, to build a market mix model (MMM) that can quantify the impact of various marketing channels on sales and optimize the marketing budget allocation. This project also demonstrates Adstock, Saturation, and Interaction effects among different media channels.

## Data

The data used in this project is `MMM_data.csv`, which contains the weekly sales and marketing spend data for a hypothetical company from January 2016 to December 2018. The data has 12 columns:

- `DATE`: The week ending date
- `revenue`: The sales revenue in thousands of dollars
- `tv_S`: The TV advertising spend in thousands of dollars
- `ooh_S`: The out-of-home advertising spend in thousands of dollars
- `print_S`: The print advertising spend in thousands of dollars
- `facebook_I`: The influencer marketing spend on Facebook in thousands of dollars
- `search_clicks_P`: The search engine marketing spend on pay-per-click ads in thousands of dollars
- `search_S`: The search engine marketing spend on search ads in thousands of dollars
- `competitor_sales_B`: The competitor sales in thousands of dollars
- `facebook_S`: The Facebook advertising spend in thousands of dollars
- `events`: The event marketing spend in thousands of dollars
- `newsletter`: The newsletter marketing spend in thousands of dollars

## Notebook

The main notebook for this project is `MMM_using_XgBoost.ipynb`, which contains the following steps:

- Data exploration and visualization
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Model interpretation and analysis
- Marketing budget optimization

The notebook can be run on Google Colab or locally with the required packages installed.
