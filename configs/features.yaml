# Feature engineering configuration for Novartis Datathon 2025
# Scenario-aware feature construction with strict leakage prevention

# Pre-entry statistics (both scenarios)
# Features derived from months_postgx < 0 only
pre_entry:
  windows: [3, 6, 12]           # Months for rolling averages: avg_vol_3m, avg_vol_6m, avg_vol_12m

  compute_volatility: true      # std(volume_pre) / avg_vol_12m
  compute_max: true             # Maximum volume in pre-entry period
  log_transform: true           # log1p(avg_vol_12m) for scale normalization

# Time features
time:

  include_is_post_entry: true         # Binary (months_postgx >= 0)
  include_time_bucket: true           # Categorical (pre, 0-5, 6-11, 12-23)

  # Cutoff behavior: features derived from n_gxs must respect scenario cutoff
  # Scenario 1: only use n_gxs for months_postgx < 0
  # Scenario 2: can use n_gxs for months_postgx < 6
